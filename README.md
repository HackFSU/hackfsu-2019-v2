## About This Site
This site is built with [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a [**React**](https://reactjs.org/)-based static site framework. It currently deploys automatically from [**Github**](https://github.com) to [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).

### How To Use
All of the content is populated from [`src/content.js`](./blob/master/src/content.js). You can edit all of the text by editing that file. The goal is to eventually replace that with a CMS, such as [**Netlify CMS**](https://www.netlifycms.org), or [**Contentful**](https://www.contentful.com/).

You can configure Netlify to automatically deploy the site when a new commit arrives on master. Netlify can also automatically deploy Pull Requests to a preview instance.
